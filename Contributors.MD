I've decided to open up the last project I did for pull requests for Hacktoberfest. 

There isn't anything functionally wrong but some things I've been thinking about are as follows:

* Advice history
* better version of the SVG coffee mug
* change the box to a conversation bubble

If you have any other suggestions about what you want to do feel free to open an issue!
