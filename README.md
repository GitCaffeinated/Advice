# Advice

Here is a short project to display the use of APIs and SVGs. I decided on an advice API because it seemed like a fun one that I haven't seen before.

I also felt I could do a couple cute little things design-wise as well for this project such as experiment with SVGs. After doing some research on how to create SVGs it seemed common to use a generator where you design it and then export the code.
